# Huggingface Directory

This directory contains files related to the Huggingface algorithms used in the NLP-Tariff project. Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose.

## Files Overview

### Huggingface Algorithm.ipynb

- **Description**: This notebook contains the core Huggingface algorithm used for processing the tariff data. It includes detailed steps on model setup, training, and evaluation.
- **Usage**: Essential for developers looking to understand or modify the machine learning pipeline.

### Huggingface Example - 1990.ipynb

- **Description**: This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the application of the Huggingface model specifically for the year 1990. It includes data loading, model application, and a brief analysis of the results.
- **Usage**: Open in Jupyter or another notebook viewer to understand model implementation for historical data analysis.

### F1 Score Comparison.ipynb

- **Description**: This notebook presents a comparison of F1 scores obtained from different model configurations or iterations. It's useful for evaluating the model's performance over various parameters.
- **Usage**: Useful for statistical analysis and performance benchmarking of the model.

### 1990 - Outputted CSV.csv

- **Description**: A CSV file containing the output of the Huggingface model for the year 1990. It lists the processed data along with predictions and relevant metrics.
- **Usage**: Can be used to directly view the model's output without running the notebook. Useful for integration with other data processing stages or for direct analysis.
